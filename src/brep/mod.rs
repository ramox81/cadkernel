//! Owned, mutable boundary representation.
//!
//! # Why this layer exists at all
//!
//! A file-format reader models topology as read-only views over a flat
//! record array, navigated by record index. That shape is right for parsing
//! and for lossless re-emission, and wrong for editing: the views borrow the
//! whole document, indices shift the moment anything is inserted, and there
//! is nowhere to put a face that a boolean has just split in two.
//!
//! So this layer owns its topology. Nodes live in arenas, keys stay stable
//! across edits, and adjacency is stored rather than rediscovered.
//!
//! # Provenance, and why it is not optional
//!
//! Every node carries the [`SourceRef`] it was lifted from, when it came
//! from a file. That single field is what keeps a save from degrading a
//! drawing:
//!
//! - a node that was never touched lowers back to its original record,
//!   byte for byte, carrying attributes and parameter-space curves that this
//!   kernel has no opinion about
//! - only a node the edit actually dirtied is re-emitted from scratch
//!
//! Without it, a boolean on one solid rewrites every solid in the file, and
//! anything the kernel does not model is lost on the way through. With it,
//! the blast radius of an edit is the edit.
