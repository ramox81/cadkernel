//! A space curve seen in a surface's own coordinates.
//!
//! Splitting a face is a two-dimensional problem. The face is a region of its
//! surface's `(u, v)` space bounded by loops; the curve that cuts it is
//! another set of `(u, v)` points; and what has to happen — where they cross,
//! which pieces the cut leaves, which side of the cut a piece is on — is
//! exactly what [`geom2d`](crate::geom2d) answers. So the last step before a
//! boolean can do anything is bringing the curve down into that space.
//!
//! ACIS calls the result a pcurve and stores one on every coedge, for the
//! same reason.
//!
//! # Parameters do not carry across
//!
//! The result traces the same *points* as the space curve, not the same
//! parameter values: a circle in space is parameterised by angle here and by
//! a fraction of a turn in [`geom2d`]. A caller needing the other curve's
//! parameter goes through the point, which both kinds invert exactly.
//! Inventing a mapping type to carry the difference would put a conversion in
//! every signature to save one call at a handful of sites.
//!
//! # Where the projection does not exist
//!
//! On a cylinder, a slanted plane's section is a sine wave in `(u, v)` — no
//! [`Curve`] variant is one, and calling it a spline would be an
//! approximation dressed as a fact. Those cases answer `None`, on the same
//! principle as [`Meeting::Unknown`](super::Meeting): a caller told nothing
//! can refuse, a caller told something wrong cannot.
