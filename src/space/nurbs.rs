//! NURBS in space: a curve that genuinely wanders, and a surface.
//!
//! [`geom2d`](crate::geom2d) has the plane's own NURBS, which is what a
//! drawing's SPLINE entity almost always is. This is the rest: a spline whose
//! points do not share a plane — a helix, a 3-D fit curve, an edge lifted out
//! of a file — and the tensor-product surface an ACIS `spline-surface` or a
//! DWG surface patch carries.
//!
//! # The same algorithm, one dimension up
//!
//! Both evaluate through [`space::spline::de_boor`](super::spline::de_boor),
//! which is written over however many coordinates a control point holds. A
//! surface is that applied twice: once along `u` for each row of the control
//! net, then once along `v` through the results. Writing the recursion again
//! per dimension is how the plane case and the space case drift apart.
//!
//! # Rational is polynomial, one dimension further up
//!
//! Weights are carried by multiplying each control point into homogeneous
//! coordinates and dividing at the very end. Dividing earlier — averaging
//! already-divided points — gives a curve that looks close and is not, and
//! the difference is exactly where the weights matter.
